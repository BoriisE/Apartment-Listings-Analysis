# Apartment-Listings-Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Study of Apartment Sale Listings**

**Project Description**
You have at your disposal data from Yandex Real Estate — an archive of apartment sale listings in Saint Petersburg and neighboring localities over several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate objects. To do this, conduct an exploratory data analysis and identify parameters affecting the price of the properties. This will enable building an automated system to detect anomalies and fraudulent activity.

For each apartment for sale, two types of data are available. The first is user-entered data, the second is automatically obtained based on mapping data. For example, distances to the city center, airport, and other locations are automatically obtained from geoservices. The number of parks and ponds nearby is also filled in without user involvement.
